In between some books I have tucked a piece of paper with a list of books
scribbled on it.

It represents what I consider one of the best questions I ever asked.

It was not the question that was so great in fact but the answer. In case
I ever lose that note, here it is:

* Against the Gods - the Remarkable Story of Risk. Peter Bernstein
* The Power of Gold - the History of Obsession. Peter Bernstein
* Thinking Fast and Slow. Daniel Kahneman.
* Nudge. Cass / Sunstein
* Chaos. James Gleick
* Systems thinking and Modelling for a Complex World. John Sterman.
  _this is a basically a textbook which I only read the first few chapters of_
* Speed of Trust. Stephen Covey
* Valuation. Stephen Koller. "The chapter on Real Options"
  _after reading through this McKinsey textbook I think the reference was to Part III -
  Applying Valuation, chapter 15, Using Option Pricing Methods to Value Flexibility_
* The Nature of Technology. W Brian Arthur
* Does IT Matter. Nicholas Carr
* Sakharov. Richard Lourie
* A Long Walk to Freedom. Nelson Mandela
* War and Peace. Tolstoy
  _I'm still not sure if this one was thrown in there as a joke!_

In 2017, over five years later, only the last three to go.
